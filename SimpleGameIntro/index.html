            <h2>GAME DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>
              Brave Dwarves is a fantasy platform game where you control one of two Dwarves fighting against 'The Great
              Evil' that has taken over their underground kingdom. The player has a warrior and a mage character to
              choose from; there are ordinary weapons for the warrior, and magic weapons (incantations) for the mage.
              Both the magical and ordinary weapon types and strength depends on the power stored in four orbs for
              controlling the four elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth. The orbs are found laying around on the map,
              and at the beginning, you only have a single weapon & attack type - for the Warrior its a plain melee
              attack with his axe - but the orbs & diamonds you find lets you use other attack types: the axe can also
              throw flaming fire, or homing missiles for example. The mage starts out with a wand that can do a water
              attack. No damage shows any blood, only smokepuffs. The orbs power source is taken from colored diamonds
              found in the caves: Green for Earth, Red for Fire, Blue for Water and White for Air. There are also some
              diamonds with combined orb energy effects: Light Blue for Air & Water and Purple for Fire & Earth. The
              underground Kingdom is divided into 50 platform levels, to finish a level three larger Key-diamonds must
              be found; one each of Green, Red and White color - these will open the door to the next level. In the
              unregistered version, only five levels are available, and there are some other limitations - the demo has
              no bosses for instance. In the caves are monsters (of course) but also treasure laying around, which is
              gathered by walking over them, and added to the player score. Touching a monster loses health. Beakers
              with blue liquid and large red hearts restore health A highscore list is available in the registered
              version, as are passwords & savegames letting a player continue from the last saved location.
